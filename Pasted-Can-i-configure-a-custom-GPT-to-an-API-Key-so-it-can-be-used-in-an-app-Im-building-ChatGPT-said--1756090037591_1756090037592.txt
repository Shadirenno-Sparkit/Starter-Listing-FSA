Can i configure a custom GPT to an API Key so it can be used in an app Im building?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, you can use a custom GPT (like one you've configured in ChatGPT's Custom GPT builder) via the OpenAI API, but with important caveats:

✅ What You Can Do
Use a custom GPT via OpenAI API (as of 2024):

When you create a custom GPT at https://chat.openai.com/gpts, it's given a unique ID.

You can invoke that GPT programmatically using the chat.completions endpoint and the custom GPT’s ID.

Configure with your API key:

Yes, you can use your personal or org-level API key to call the custom GPT.

This enables your app to interact with your configured GPT just like it would with gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, etc.

Maintain the custom instructions and tools:

The GPT you’ve built will retain:

Its system prompt (persona, behavior, etc.)

Uploaded files/knowledge base

Functions (tool use), if defined in the builder.

❗ Limitations
No fine-tuning control: You cannot fully programmatically change the GPT’s internal logic once it’s published. Use function calling or external tools for dynamic behavior.

Rate limits and costs: Using the custom GPT via the API consumes your OpenAI usage quota and follows the same pricing model as the underlying model (e.g., gpt-4o).

🧠 How to Do It — Sample API Call
Here’s how you'd call a custom GPT from your app:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Beta: gpts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "tools": [],
    "custom_gpt_id": "your-custom-gpt-id"
  }'
Or in Python:

python
Copy
Edit
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    custom_gpt_id="your-custom-gpt-id",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message['content'])
🔐 Where to Find Your custom_gpt_id
You can find it by:

Visiting your GPT at chat.openai.com/gpts

Opening the GPT in the editor

Copying the URL — it will look like https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor/<GPT_ID>
